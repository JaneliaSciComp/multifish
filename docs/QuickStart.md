# Quick Start

## Nextflow Tower Quick Start

The easiest way to use the EASI-FISH pipeline is by running it from the Nextflow Tower web GUI interface. See the [step-by-step instructions here](tower/NextflowTower.html).

## Command-line Quick Start

For tech-savvy users, the pipeline can be invoked from the command-line and runs on any workstation or cluster. The only prerequisites for running this pipeline are [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io) (version 20.10.0 or greater) and [Singularity](https://sylabs.io) (version 3.5 or greater).

To [install Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html):

    curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash

Alternatively, you can install it as a conda package:

    conda create --name multifish -c bioconda nextflow

To [install Singularity](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.7/admin-guide/installation.html) on CentOS Linux:

    sudo yum install singularity

Once the prerequisites are installed, you should clone this repository with the following command:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/multifish.git

Before running the pipeline for the first time, run setup to pull in external dependencies:

    ./setup.sh

You can now launch the pipeline using:

    ./main.nf [arguments]

## Demo Data Sets

To get running quickly, there are [example scripts](https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/multifish/tree/master/examples) provided which download EASI-FISH example data and run the full pipeline. You can analyze the smallest data set like this:

    ./examples/demo_tiny.sh <data dir> [arguments]

The `data dir` is the path to where you want to store the data and analysis results. You can add additional arguments to skip steps previously completed or add monitoring with [Nextflow Tower](https://tower.nf). See below for additional details about the argument usage.

The script will download a [demo data set](https://doi.org/10.25378/janelia.c.5276708.v1) and run the full analysis pipeline. It is tuned for a 40 core machine with 128 GB of RAM and runs for about 30 minutes. If your compute resources are different, you may need to edit the script to change the parameters to suit your environment.

After the pipeline runs, you can expect to find 5.8 GB in the data dir:

    1.4G     /opt/demo_tiny/inputs
    4.4G     /opt/demo_tiny/outputs
    320K    /opt/demo_tiny/spark

There is also a `demo_small.sh` with larger data:

    23G     /opt/demo_small/inputs
    58G     /opt/demo_small/outputs
    525M    /opt/demo_small/spark

And a `demo_medium.sh` with that requires 209 GB in total:

    65G     /opt/demo_medium/inputs
    145G    /opt/demo_medium/outputs
    665M    /opt/demo_medium/spark

## Algorithms

The current implementation provides, for certain steps, multiple algorithms that can be used. For example for spot extraction you have the option to use Airlocalize or RS_FISH. For registration you can use the legacy version that only supports ransac and deform or a newer DASK based implementation that gives you a lot more flexibility in the choice of registration algorithms. For segmentation you also have two options: starfinity or cellpose. Cellpose also uses a DASK cluster to divide and perform the work.
